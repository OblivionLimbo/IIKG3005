1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
In this video, we will now begin to see how we can test our infrastructure,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,200
so that it is certain that it meets the requirements we want it to meet

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,400
before it is deployed to Microsoft Azure in our context.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,320
So the idea is that we can of course run some tests on the infrastructure

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,920
against our infrastructure via VS Code, as we use here,

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,200
before we eventually push it to the Git repository,

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,400
which is a trigger for a workflow that again goes through some different steps to get there.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,480
But that's what the idea is here now, that we're going to get integrated tests

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,080
as part of this workflow, so that we, for example, now can run this infrastructure

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,200
through a number of tests in a different branch.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,600
And when these tests are verified and eventually approved,

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,720
then we can run a pull request, that is, that we merge the branch that we have set up with main,

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,200
so that it becomes the relevant infrastructure for the infrastructure that is in Azure.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,120
And there are some steps and some new things we are going to introduce now in this video,

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,040
and there are also some tools that we use, i.e. what we use to test it.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,680
There are many different tools we can use to test our infrastructure,

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
so we can test the code, we can test the security of the code, etc.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,840
But we take some that we are going through now,

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,680
and then of course we can also link to some different sites,

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,600
where we have several different tests that we can go through.

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,360
As you can see, there are a lot of reds that are screaming out in my VS code now,

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,600
and that's because I've installed something called Checkov.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,120
Checkov is a tool that helps me, and so maybe a little in the strictest way,

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,680
for a demo test that we're going to do now,

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,240
because it is very much on what has to do with security, and that's good.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,960
And then it comes with recommendations on what it is that it wants to do,

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,560
so that we can satisfy the potential security threats that are relevant.

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,200
But there are several tools, and there is one, as I said,

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,920
I have posted information on which tools I am testing now,

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,840
and the way we install them is in our own.

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,240
What we can start with, if we take Terraform validate,

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,560
so it is also a test that we can run.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,080
We can integrate that Terraform validate is part of our test in GitHub Actions.

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,440
Because then you can see that if we run Terraform validate,

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,880
then you can check if the configuration is valid.

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,880
If it is not valid, then you will get a error message that this is not correct.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,360
So if I, for example, on my main here,

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,680
this is a demo infrastructure that I have set up,

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,640
which I already run in Azure portal.

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,400
But then I have a slightly different approach here.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Here I only have different files that represent the different resources I have set up.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,960
And then I have a main file where I have set up a resource group for all the resources here.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,680
So you can take a look at that.

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,200
I have Provider, Main, Network, Storage Account, Variables and Key Vault,

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,560
which I use here now.

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,960
I have Terraform TF Wars and Secret TF Wars in addition to that.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,200
So if I now, for example, have changed here that the resource group should be like this,

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,560
especially if something is written wrong,

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,120
if something is going to happen to the variable here,

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,440
so if I save it, then Terraform validate will now say that I use the name of a resource group

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,080
that is not declared from before.

52
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,400
So it will not get any names here.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,120
And this can also be a simple test that we can implement in our GitHub Actions,

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,680
which then checks if this is approved to be deployed further.

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,880
So we can start with such a simple test as that we try to integrate Terraform validate,

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,800
and then we can then look further at different more advanced tests afterwards.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I just quickly change this back so that it is correct like that.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,160
And then we can see here now that it validates,

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,480
because then it matches the way it is in our infrastructure now.

60
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,640
And then I just take Terraform plan out.

61
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
I can change Terraform plan because I have no changes.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm just going to show you that this is already running like this in Microsoft Azure

63
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,320
with some resources that are already created.

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,080
Infrastructure matches configuration, just go here.

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,880
RG Demo, here's Key Vault, NSG, Public IP, storage account, VM, disk,

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,200
NIC and the VM network to the machine.

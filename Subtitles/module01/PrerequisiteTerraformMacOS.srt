00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
In this video, we are going to go through what we need from prerequisites to be able to get started with the use of Terraform in the course Infrastructure as a Code.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:15,840
We are going to install the necessary software, including Azure CLI, Terraform, and we are going to install some extensions to VS Code,

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,680
because we use VS Code as a program to perform these tasks.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,820
What we do first is that we can jump over to Visual Studio Code.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:32,540
If I don't have Visual Studio Code, I can add a link that makes it possible to get some guidance on how to install VS Code.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,940
You can also use Brew to install VS Code.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,900
I'm here now in my Visual Studio Code, and I'm going to install something called Homebrew.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,260
What is Homebrew? Homebrew is a package manager that makes it possible to install the software,

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,780
just by using command lines instead of going online, loading the installation file, and running the installation on the machine.

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,780
What we can do is, like the title says, Homebrew is the missing package manager for Mac OS and Word Linux.

11
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,980
We can just copy this command and run it in VS Code or Terminal.

12
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:13,500
I could of course write Terminal and open Terminal and run the command here, but since it is now in VS Code, I use one of them.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,100
Here we have the command we run is this one. I can just copy it from here.

14
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,740
Here we see that I have opened an active Terminal window. If you don't have a Terminal window, you can just stand like this,

15
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,300
or if you are at the very beginning of VS Code, you can just drag to the beginning and it will show up in the Terminal window.

16
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:43,180
If you want to change which shell you are in, I'm now in Seashell, for example, let's see, there was a bit of guidance like this.

17
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:52,540
Here we see that we get the different shells we are in. We can be in Bash, PowerShell, Seashell, Azure Cloud Shell, Azure Cloud Shell, PowerShell, etc.

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm now in Seashell, because I'm going to install it here, and then I just run the command that makes it get the installation file,

19
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,380
or run the installation script that is necessary to install Homebrew.

20
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,220
Let it just stand and go a bit, and then we'll see what happens when it's done.

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:20,900
Write in my password on the Mac, like this, and then we'll see. It will mostly say that I already have it, but it can just stand and go, and then we'll see what it is.

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,940
When Brew is installed, it's okay to always do Brew Update, because it ensures that you get the last packages available,

23
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,180
so that you can always update it, possibly if it's Azure Shell, or PowerShell, or something to the latest version.

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,860
Also, it's important that you have the latest version of Package Manager in addition.

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,740
So, the first thing that stands here is PowerShell. Most of us may not have PowerShell from before, but I'll just install it now,

26
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,020
because it may come up that we need to use PowerShell.

27
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:55,060
I just run Brew Install, PowerShell, and then I just show here that if we also have PowerShell, and there is a new version of PowerShell,

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,140
then we can also run a Brew Upgrade PowerShell to implement it.

29
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,740
I show here below in Azure CLI that there are several ways you can do this.

30
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,060
You can run a Brew Upgrade and install Azure CLI in one and the same command.

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,060
To run a Brew Upgrade, install Azure CLI, we run through it.

32
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:22,060
I already have it, and this command should be, I should say, only if you need to update, and then you can just paste it in.

33
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:32,780
As you can see, there is a large number of text files in the repository for the color, so you can simply copy in the commands you want.

34
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,740
Once we're done running Azure CLI, we're going to install Terraform.

35
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:46,540
Then we can first start by installing HersheyCorpTap, which is a repository for HersheyCorp's program.

36
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,580
Then we just run it in, and then we can install HersheyCorpTap Terraform.

37
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:01,580
As you can see, I have installed most of the things here, but I can admit that some of them have to be updated, so I do it in the same way.

38
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:12,500
Here we also see that you can run an update and an install, or you can run an upgrade here instead of if you run a Brew Upgrade and a Brew Update.

39
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,060
We can run it in the same way, just to show that we can run it in the same command if we want to, already up to date.

40
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:27,860
This is fine. So then we have what we need from Terraform, we have what we need from Azure CLI on our own, but the highlight is Extensions.

41
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:40,420
We also need the necessary help we need in Visual Studio Code, so we can also go under Extensions, and here we can search for Terraform.

42
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:50,500
Under Terraform, we see that there will be a HersheyCorpTap Terraform extension, and we want to have it, so we can just add it to the prerequisites here.

43
00:04:50,500 --> 00:05:00,820
So we do like this, and then we will have PowerShell, and then we will have Azure CLI, and then we can just see that it is under Extensions now.

44
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:12,980
So if you are going to install it, it does not say disabled or uninstalled, it says installed, so if you also take PowerShell in the same line, then we see here that PowerShell, I already have that.

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,300
Azure CLI Tools, and I already have that installed.

46
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:31,700
In addition, I also use something called Rainbow CSV, which means that if I work with CSV files, then I get a much more visual presentation of these CSV files, so this one is color-coded.

47
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:40,260
They separate, or they are the columns, so we release and then count parentheses, or tabs, or semicolons, or whatever should be over there.

48
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,940
Look here, Rainbow CSV, this one can color-code all types of files that have a certain space between the contents.

49
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,180
So then we can go back to the prerequisites, and then we can just write on this one, and so on.

50
00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:04,100
And then we have received the installation of our necessary programs, Brew is of course just the macOS package manager, which means that we can easily install and update the software we use.

51
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:17,700
If you do not have VS Code after Brew, then we can put it here like this, and then we have Brew, and then I can show you how to find these commands, because it's like, how do I know what to write?

52
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:33,620
Yes, but then you can go to Brew on the side, and then we just write VS Code, and here we see that OK, Access VS Code, Visual Studio Code, it goes out to you, and then we see here Brew install, Visual Studio Code, just take it with you, paste it in.

53
00:06:33,620 --> 00:07:01,780
In addition, if you are going to update VS Code with Brew, then we have the same command, we can take this one, and then we can see here now that if we then run this command here, then it will maybe say that OK, Visual Studio Code is not installed, it is probably because I have installed it via Brew, the first time I did.

54
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:14,260
But enough about that, if you choose to do it that way, then at least I have the opportunity to manage it via Brew instead of running and downloading the versions that are available on the website, and then you have to install it manually.

55
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:21,620
And that was actually all I wanted to go through in this video, so see you in the next video to get started with the use of Terraform for infrastructure as a code.

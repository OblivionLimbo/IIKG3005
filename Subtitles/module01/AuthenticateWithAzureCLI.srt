00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
In this video, we're going to see how we can connect to our Azure tenant using Azure Seal Eye.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,720
Now we have access to the portal.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
We have made sure that our users have enough rights in the portal.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,760
We have set up an app registration or a service principle.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,280
We have given our service principle enough rights.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,760
So the last thing we do now is to make sure that we can actually connect to our tenant using Azure Seal Eye.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,360
We have continued to work with Azure Service Principle using Azure Seal Eye.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,160
So if we click on view file more, we can see to sign in with the service principle in the app in the tenant to the password.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,920
And that is the information we have now after we have set up our service principle.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,320
And then we can either go and copy and paste.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,800
Then we can go to Visual Studio Code.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
And here I have just pasted again.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,040
Here I have some of my information in color text.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm going to remove this so it's not any sensitive information anyway.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,280
I have the display name and the rename, but I'm not going to use it anyway either.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,200
So what I have to do now is that I have to have an app in mine.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
We have to paste it in there.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,720
Then we have to have the secret, then we have to have it in there.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,120
And then we have to have the tenant in ours.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,280
We have to have it in there.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
So then when we have everything we need, we have the command we need.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,800
We specify how we are going to log in.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
We have the username, we have the password, we have the tenant we are going to use.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,520
Then we can just run this command.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,880
Just right-click and choose Run Line in Terminal.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,080
Let's see.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,080
So, it was just that I was wrong.

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,520
Then we see that we have logged in.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Now we are connected to the tenant in it.

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
Then we do a quick check to confirm that we are actually logged in to the tenant.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,480
It is that we can go back to this documentation for Azure CLI.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,960
You can find the different commands you can use.

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,000
For example, EC account manager, Azure subscription information.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,560
Then we can click on the different ones if we want to go into the different commandlets.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,440
To see how they are going to be used.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,720
One thing that can happen is, for example, the resource groups as a main on this tenant.

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,520
So we can just search for group.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
EC group, we see here.

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
Manage resource group, then template deployments.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
We click on that.

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,920
Then we can see over here how the commandlets we have.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Here we have, for example, EC group list.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Then we see that list resource groups.

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
If we just take that one.

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,960
Back to VS Code and paste it.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,200
Then we see that it is going to list out the resource groups you have in the tenant.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,080
We see here that the format is that you have both the subscription, the height of the subscription, the resource group and where it is located.

48
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,800
What location it is in.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,760
But if you, for example, only want to know the names.

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,200
Then you can write, for example, EC group list dash table.

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,920
Then we see here that we list out the resource groups in a more readable form.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,960
Instead of getting it in such a JSON format.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,720
And if you see here now, you see that we have the resource group that was set up in conjunction with the fact that we needed a resource group.

54
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,960
To be able to operate a storage account that was necessary to run the cloud shell we used to operate the service principle.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,080
So then we see here that we have this available.

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,320
We can also, for example, go into the tenant via Azure portal.

57
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,840
So we open Azure portal.

58
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Then we see here, tenant 01.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Then we go to resource groups.

60
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
We use there.

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,840
Then we see here that we also have a list and a list of which resource groups are in this tenant.

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720
And then we see that we have some connected tenants in the portal.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,080
We are also connected to the VS code.

64
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
And then we have done everything together so that we can begin to deploy resources.

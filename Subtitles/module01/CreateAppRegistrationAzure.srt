1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
In this video, we're going to set up a service principle, or an app registration,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,000
which allows us to connect to our internet via Visual Studio Code,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which we use to push or to set up our infrastructure using Terraform later in this class.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,800
To do this, you can see here, we go to the documentation for Microsoft,

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,800
which is in Work with Azure Service Principle using the Azure CLI.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,000
Azure CLI is a command line network that makes it possible for us to communicate with Azure,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and we can do that via Web GUI when we're going to set up this service principle.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So if we now click on the link Create Service Principle,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we see here that when you create a service principle, and use this command line,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it will output credentials that are in plain text, which we have to take care of.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is important, we have to take care of it, because it will show up at some point,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so we don't have to set up a new secret password later to log in.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you're a little unsure about what a service principle or an app registration is,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
it says a little bit about what it is about here.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can read it if you want.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Here it just quickly goes through how we set it up, so that we can see and connect

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to our Azure tenant with Visual Studio Code.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What we do is that it takes with us this command here,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
for this, Create a Service Principle with the required parameters.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then we see here that MySubscriptionID is the one we're going to have with us,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to be able to choose where we're going to have the rights with the service principle that we set up.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I just copy it in, and then I go here.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here we see that we have something called, up at the top there,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
we have a command line limit.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What we see is, welcome to Azure Cloud Shell.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We now just press bash, and then I choose that I must have a storage account,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
because there are some files that are going to be set up,

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so then I just choose Create Storage Account.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We don't need to think so much about it now.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now we go through what we need to get it in place,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so that we can get started.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A storage account comes back to what it is,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but as the name suggests, it's a place where we can and need it.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This can take a while, but when it comes and is set up,

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we get a command prompt that we can use.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
When the Cloud Shell is ready to use,

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
we're going to paste in this command of ours,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and then we're going to hack the subscription ID,

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
because that's what we see that we need.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now I have MySubscriptionID,

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and then we have it available in our tenant.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And then it looks like this.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now the Cloud Shell is ready.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can just paste in my command.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In addition, I have to go to Subscription,

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
because I need this ID now,

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so I just take it with me with it,

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and then I choose to paste it in.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And when I press Enter now,

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will ... Sorry, we have to have Roll, of course.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Roll, and that should then be Contributor.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Contributor means that you have the ability

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to remove or add new rights,

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but you have to have full Contributor,

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
that is, contribute to the subscription ID that gives it.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So you can update and delete all kinds of resources in there,

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but you can't remove resources,

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
no, access for others with Contributor.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So, we just press Enter on it,

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
a little script file on it.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Like that.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then I think it will work much better.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And there we see that now the service principle is updated,

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and then we see here that we get our App ID,

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
we get the display name,

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
we also get the password or the secret,

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and this is the one we have to take care of.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So now it is important that the one who updates this service principle

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
takes care of this information.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I like to store it in a place where you don't

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
share and have all the information,

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
for example, the alternate ID,

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
or sometimes you don't need to have stored together

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
with the App ID and password,

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
because that's what usually connects to the tenant.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you use a password manager,

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
please put it in there,

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
because then you can see here now that I need to take

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
this information with me,

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
because it will not be available to me.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Later, when I close this window,

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
then we can see that this one has a display name,

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
then this is the display name,

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can show you right here that we have a commandlet

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
that makes it possible to set a name

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
so that we do not get a random name,

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
but if we go to Azure Active Directory,

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then we scroll down to App Registrations,

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
All App Applications,

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
then we see here that now it has Azure CLI

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
with today's data and so on.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If I click on this one,

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
then I can, for example,

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
choose to change the name,

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
for example, to App Tim,

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
just like that,

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
to make it so that the initials

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
show that it is mine,

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
because you want to share this tenant with several,

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
so it's stupid if you have a lot of different names,

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and now it shows that now I have an App Tim

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that is mine,

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and then there would like to be more down there,

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
because students can share the tenant with you.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you want to set this up in the same line,

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
then you can see that under the command that is run now,

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
then we have a service principal,

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
where we can specify both the names

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
on our service principal,

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
how the role it should have,

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and the scope.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Here you can see that the example in this one

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
shows a resource group,

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but we can still just stop the subscription in it,

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
so if we just take this,

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
write a name as we want,

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
write that it should be contributor,

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and then we take subscription and subscription ID,

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then we get all the information at once,

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so we let go,

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and think that we have to rename it in the portal.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But again, now we have set up our service principal,

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
we need to take care of this,

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because then we will see how to connect us up

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
with SLCLI via VS Code later.

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:07
Now we have looked at how to use variables directly in our main.tf file, a standalone variable file, 

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
and with input directly in the command line, when we run and plan the deployment. 

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
But, there is another way to do this; 

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:24
we can create a new file that we'll call "terraform.tfvars".

5
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Then we see that we have another terraform file,

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33
which will then contain the configuration of our variables. 

7
00:00:33 --> 00:00:41
We'll then have our resources in main, our variables in variables, and the content of the variables in terraform.tfvars.

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:50
A smart way to proceed is to split the screen into the variable file and the tfvars file. 

9
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
So if we then click on this icon in the top right, we can split the screen vertically,

10
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
we'll keep the tfvars file on one side and the variable file on the other. 

11
00:00:59 --> 00:01:06
Because what we have to do is bring these variables into the tfvars file.

12
00:01:06 --> 00:01:14
And since everything is a string, the file will look like shown on screen. 

13
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
Had we had integers or booleans there would not be quotes around the values.

14
00:01:19 --> 00:01:26
Location will then be "West Europe", and the resource group name will be "rg-tfvar-demo",

15
00:01:26 --> 00:01:36
and storage account name will be "satfvardemo123".

16
00:01:36 --> 00:01:47
Now we have prepared the content of the tfvars file, and we have to remember to save all the files,

17
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
so that everything is correct and up to date. 

18
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
Then we'll run a "terraform init" again,

19
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
and then the only thing that remains is running a "terraform plan",

20
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
just to see if we receive the information from the tfvars file as we expect.

21
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
Scrolling through the plan we can verify that everything is as expected; 

22
00:02:06 --> 00:02:14
the resource group name has changed to what we set it as. 

23
00:02:14 --> 00:02:22
Same goes for the storage account name and the location.

24
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
Then everything works as expected.

25
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
Now we have main for our resources, variables for our defined variables,

26
00:02:29 --> 00:02:34
and terraform.tfvars for the values of the variables.

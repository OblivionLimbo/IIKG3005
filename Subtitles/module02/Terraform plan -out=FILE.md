In this video we will delve deeper into the use of the different commands that we briefly touched upon in our first deployment of a resource. Some of it will be repetition, but we will try to further develop the techniques we have already learned.

If I firstly go to my Visual Studio Code environment. My folder structure is based on the course materials, and then iterating through each module. I'll then go to my second folder as we are expanding upon the previous lecture. I will basically create everything anew because as we continue on in this course we will learn how to make better folder and file structures for development, testing and production environments. But for now, we will keep the simple structure we have already created. How you want to do it is up to you, but here you can see an example setup.

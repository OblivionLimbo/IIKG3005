00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
In the previous video we looked at how we can use variables directly in our .tf file, 

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
but now we will implement a standalone variable file. 

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:11
The way we do that is, standing in the same folder as the previous video, create a new file, 

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:15
and call it "variables.tf".

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:24
And then ill cut the variables from the main.tf file and paste them in the new variables.tf file. 

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
The thing that is important to note now is that is that every tf file under the same folder, 

7
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
when we run terraform init, counts as a single config. 

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:43
So that main.tf, variables.tf, output.tf and everything else will be considered as one and the same config.

9
00:00:44 --> 00:00:54
Now we have our main.tf and our variables.tf file, the dot signifiying its not saved yet, so remember to do so. 

10
00:00:57 --> 00:01:08
If we want more comments we can use a "#" sign, and then write our comments in our files. 

11
00:01:08 --> 00:01:22
Now that we have exported our variables to a separate file, we can run terraform init again,

12
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
to initiate the new variables.tf file, and the new config. 

13
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
As I already said, everything within here is what represents the configuration. 

14
00:01:32 --> 00:01:39
When that is done, we now have the variable file, 

15
00:01:39 --> 00:01:45
and if we then run the same command as earlier, (terraform plan ...), it will still be applicable,

16
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
if we give it the same values as before.

17
00:01:50 --> 00:01:59
But we can give it some other input just to show that it works even though we moved the variables.

18
00:01:59 --> 00:02:05
So we'll edit some of the values, and run the plan it will create a plan. 

19
00:02:05 --> 00:02:12
Then we will see we'll get the same outcome whether we have a separate variable file or not.

20
00:02:13 --> 00:02:20
If we scroll up we can see that the variables have changed according to what we did in the plan command. 

21
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
This makes everything much more readable.

22
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
Had we had everything in a long main.tf file, it would have become messy and hard to read.

23
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
But when we have a separate file for our variables, we keep it condensed into bite-sized, readable chunks,

24
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
which makes it easier to read and understand, when we manage a larger infrastructure.

25
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
We don't have to deploy this either, as its the first step on how we can use variables, 

26
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
in the next video we'll take the next step and have a look at a .tfvars file.

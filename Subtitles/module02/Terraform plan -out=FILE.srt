00:00:00 --> 00:00:08
- In this video we will delve deeper into the use of the different commands that we briefly touched upon in our first deployment of a resource. 

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
- Some of it will be repetition, but we will try to further develop the techniques we have already learned.

3
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
- If I firstly go to my Visual Studio Code environment.

4
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
- My folder structure is based on the course materials, and then iterating through each module. 

5
00:00:25 --> 00:00:32
- I'll then go to my second folder as we are expanding upon the previous lecture. 

6
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
- I will basically create everything anew,

7
00:00:37 --> 00:00:44
- because as we continue on in this course we will learn how to make better folder and file structures,

8
00:00:44 --> 00:00:50
- for development, testing and production environments. 

9
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
- But for now, we will keep the simple structure,

10
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
- where I start in an empty folder for each deployment.

00:00:58 --> 00:01:04
How you want to do it is up to you, but here you can see an example setup.

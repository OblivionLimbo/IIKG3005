00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
In this video, we are going to look at the use of environmental variables.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,960
We find under registry, terraform, IO providers, etc. etc. under RRM.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:18,600
The reason we want to use environmental variables is because we might let go of the option for sensitive information to come in clear text.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:30,720
We will run a VC login, for example, because terraform has the necessary information through client ID, security, tenant ID, subscription ID in the environmental variable available.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,360
Then it understands and knows where it should perform the handling.

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:43,320
So if you look here, the way we use this value is that we are of course status 01 here with the input we have available.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,520
It will then be client ID, security, tenant ID and subscription ID.

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,920
All of this is known to us, we have already used it via VC login, but we can now simply paste it in instead of in the terminal.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,680
Once you use environmental variables like this, the variable is short-lived.

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:08,760
So if I paste it in and have thought, as I said, paste in all of this, which was the value for this.

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,520
So when I paste in and press enter now, and of course have the correct information, which is after for my user.

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Then it will be gone when I close the terminal window here, so no one can use it afterwards if I paste it in.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,800
So it is stored for this session and only this session.

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,240
The next time I open it, I have to paste it in.

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,600
I also recommend that you store the information here in your own private key vault or encrypted information that you do not get access to here.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,240
Of course, we are only dealing with a demo environment, but in a real world scenario, this would be the information that has been stored and secured.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:02:00,000
So if I now press enter on this, I will put this as the variable, and then I can afterwards list out and see how the information that is in these variables.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,160
So what I do, if I paste it in and put it here, now it's just this one.

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:20,560
But if I paste it in, and then I write in, it's a bit different from the operating system, but then I see here now that I have the subscription client secret identity, which is in my environmental variables.

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:42,320
And that would just say that if I, for example, now have been and is in the back-end folder and run Terraform init and Terraform plan and apply, then I have used the information that has been stored here.

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,040
Of course, I would not want anything that is valid and functional here, but of course you have to enter your information.

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:03:03,760
And what I have to think about now, if I now press to just close this terminal, and then I take up a new one, then we can see that if I write in now, I do not have these environmental variables available anymore, because it is a new session.

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:18,400
So that for each time I put it in here, and then I write in, then I see that I have them available at the bottom and can then just start rolling out the infrastructure via Terraform without having to do ac login and so on.

24
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:28,640
And this is the same information that we put into GitHub, which is the variables that we can use when we want to run GitHub Actions alone.

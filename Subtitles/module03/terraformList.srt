00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
In this video, we're going to see how we can use more complex variable types.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,060
And then we'll start by going to our variables file.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,000
Here we have all the variables that we've worked with in module 3.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,840
And then I can now type in variables, and then I'll type in, for example, just here.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,740
AZ_regions, for example.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,540
And then I can now take and do.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,940
Here you can see that my co-pilot is actually coming up with a pretty good suggestion.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,940
I can let it be for now, so we can go through it manually.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:41,640
For that, we have to write type, and then we have to write that we have to define what type of variable it is.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,040
And that will be a list.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,540
In addition, we also have to put in parentheses what the content in this list should be for now.

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:55,640
Because it can only be one type of content in this one that we remember from the other variables.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,640
So we define, we have actually just defined string all the way here.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,040
But if we want a list, it can be string, it can be bool, or it can be number.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,240
So if we then take string in this case, then we can take description.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,040
And then we can write Azure regions for resources.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,040
And then we can have default value.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,640
And then we see here that the value comes up with brackets aroudn itself.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,040
And then we also have to, of course, since this is strings, have quotes around it.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,740
So if we then, let's see, I think we need, depending on you.

21
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,540
So if we then just write North Europe.

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,940
So West, like that.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,140
Let's see, maybe it has West US.

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,940
Yes, we don't need to have something more since we have taken what we need.

25
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,840
And what we can see now is that we have defined a list.

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,340
This can be seen as an array or something like that, if you are familiar with it from before,

27
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,340
another scripting or programming.

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,440
And then it would say that the content that is here, it always starts at zero.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,440
And the content here is what becomes number one, and then two and three, of course.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,240
So let's see how we can use it, so that we specify which one we want to have.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,040
So if we then take, I can take West Europe here.

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,140
And since I've just used it most before.

33
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,440
So, remember to save it.

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,040
So the way I use it here, it would be when I go to my main.tf.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,840
And then we can say here, we already have var location.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,640
But I'm just going to show you how we can use it in the resource group.

37
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,340
Because then it will be var, and then it will be azregion.

38
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,040
And then we see here that we can fill in with, for example, specify zero.

39
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,540
When we say zero, it will be the first in this list, which will then be West Europe in our case.

40
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,540
And we can see that if we go here.

41
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,640
If we then just save it in, run terraform init.

42
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,840
We drag it a little further up, and then run terraform console;

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,740
var.azregions[0], so we just have azregions.

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,140
No, let's see.

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,440
So, now we see that if we define it like that, we see that we have different output on it.

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,640
So when we then put it here, it will then get the information from the list itself.

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,040
And that way we can use the content list, or a variable with a type of list.

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,140
If we were to have another type of content here, we had to define, for example, that it should be boolean.

49
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:41,340
Because we could not have had that this would have been like that, North Europe, and false.

50
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:50,240
This is not a legal value for the list, where we have to define that it has one type of content.

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,640
So then we can just check, if we exit out of the console, take like that, terraform plan.

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,940
But we can still take the version like that.

53
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,340
Then we write there, because now North Europe will be set instead of West Europe.

54
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,940
Then we take terraform fmt, to get better readability.

55
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,940
And then we take terraform plan -out=main.tfplan.

56
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:29,640
When the plan is done, we can just see here that we have received that the storage account will be set in North Europe.

57
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,440
And then we have seen that we can pick up that information from a list.

58
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,840
That was actually what I was going to go through with the list type.

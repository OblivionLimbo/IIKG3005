1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now we are very well prepared to take on modules, but because we can start to buy them, we start to take a cart in your output.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Because it is possible to have modules with modules, such as road modules, child modules, and even if you are at a higher level with child modules.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It is possible to be able to use them and see information.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is a module that allows you to do a training course, if you are going to talk about a network or a connected one module,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
then you want to have more information, because it is also possible to talk about a module over it.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Maybe road modules.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We start with a module, maybe a few, but it is a bit like this.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We start first.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But we can start to buy the first output, and then we can think about the cost.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now we can use this scene.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So what we are going to do is that we can create a output block, and then we can, for example, write here that it is going to be s-a-ide.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And then we can think that if we want to get a large account, then we will get a bit of ID.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We can now get a bit of ID, and then we have to get a bit of ID.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So therefore we have to get a bit of ID here, and then we have to get a bit of ID.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then we have to get a bit of ID to get a bit of ID.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
From the copy-election, we have to get a bit of ID.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And that is also possible to get a bit of ID.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to get a value, I want a value, I want a value, I want a value, I want a s-a-dm storage account,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
a s-a-dm, which is a name on this one.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So this is the s-a-dm, and we have to get a bit of ID.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now we can start writing this as we see that we have a whole deal with ask for an answer

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
which we actually read, especially since we are sent out But everything is still on our account.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But have to get a large account, and then we have to get an ID I-a-dm.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,680
That's right, now we have to object to pick something a new thing like

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,000
If we have to run on Terraform and RAID subway TerraformIo, then we have to get a BEST in Transure documentation.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So now we have to write storage accounts.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm going to write a story, and then we'll search for a review of the references.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So let's say here that we have all the things that we can do on the back,

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to find the information that we're going to do on the outside.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So here was the idea, and that could be, for example, if you're going to talk about the network,

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
then you might be able to go into the network, like,

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
e-prange, or something like that, and that's very special, for example,

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if you're going to talk about the network, then you're going to have to go into the network.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So that was actually what we had planned to do now,

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to get an output, but now we have to check that it works.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's what's important to think about now, that it's a value on output.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We don't want to come and show it to the audience, because it's that the resources don't exist,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
when we do the plan.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Therefore, I think that we have to do the whole run with the plan and apply.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So let's do it for a minute.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So let's do it for the plan out.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not for the plan.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
When the plan is done, let's do it for the plan.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, no.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Change, change the output.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Assault ID, no one after the plan.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Plan two, two that are dead.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And then we can see here that it's not...

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Start check and resource group.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's what will be applied.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So that's the plan.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So let's see if the story is over.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And maybe we have a lot of work to do.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, no, we have heard for the apply.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So let's see here that we have completed resources to edit outputs.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Assault ID, and this is the entire ID that is represented.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Start check out.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So we have to do it.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We can go into the plan, but let's see if the resource has to do it.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Any resource groups, let's see here.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll give it a name.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll give it a name.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Assault Team Demo 2643.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll give it a name.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I'll give it a name.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Find out.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For example, I'll give it a name.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Jason, I'll give it a name.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So that we have a large account,

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which is the same one we got.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And now that we've got the name,

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
with the large account,

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
in the third form,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we can see the output,

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and use the name in an A in the same name.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And if we have to configure the output,

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
or with the name, this resource,

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we can refer this name,

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
because we have to set it up.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And if this resource has been represented

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
with an A in the module,

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
we can see this in the Over-Test.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a road module,

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but we'll do it more with this resource.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's what I'm thinking about.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll give it a name.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll give it a name.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll give it a name.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Map is a module 3,

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but maybe the next module 4,

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we'll have a top road module

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
with several smaller modules.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I just want to say a summary

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
of the four modules,

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
with a configuration,

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
set it up with the resource line in the same name.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But as always, the third form,

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
destroy, and then we can see

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
that we've done it.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We've got the name,

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and then we've got the resource group,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and the resource group,

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and then we're going to use the name,

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and then we're going to use the name,

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Erscher.

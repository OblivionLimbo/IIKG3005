1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
In this video, we're going to look at a new type.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,760
We're going to look at Variables Maps.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,440
As we said, we're going to write variables again.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,960
We're going to write, for example,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
a nice use case for using Maps.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,280
For example, VM size.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,600
Where you can have mapping between

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,680
what the name of the VM is,

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,160
and what it is in, for example, Azure.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,840
If we look at Azure's VM name,

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,920
i.e. Sizes, or Stock Keeping Unit, as it was called,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,400
we can easily make a mapping between

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,680
what type of VM we want to use.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
We haven't used a VM with Terraform yet,

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,520
but I can just show you an example of it,

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,520
but you can also see if we find a good use case here.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,760
Because this is standard B2S.

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,120
It will be difficult to remember,

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,120
so if we know that in a configuration, or in a setup,

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,640
we're just going to have a type of VM,

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,640
we can, for example, do something like this.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,200
We type, type equals map,

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,240
and then we write a string.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,640
No, we don't need to have that one there.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
And then we write default, like this.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
We can just do that.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,800
And then we can see that if, for example,

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,560
we set up the VM there, it should be this version.

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,240
If we set up the VM there, it should be this version.

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,640
In a way, we can check what this type of info is,

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,600
and then based on that, this VM size will be selected.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,040
We can also, for example, have written that it has been small,

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,840
medium, and then we add large, like that.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
And then we have simply now been able to specify that,

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
ok, variable VM size,

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,640
and also said, for example, ok, should it be small, medium, or large,

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,560
then it would have been the VM,

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,520
the stock shipping unit of the VM we have received when we deployed it.

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,560
So then we can easily see here,

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,360
the shipping unit looks like we are sure of the format.

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,160
We can write var.vm-size.small.

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,920
Then we see here that we get,

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,760
the content will then be standard,

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,120
MB1S, medium, large.

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,320
Then we see that there is a key pair,

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,840
so we have one value that is mapped to another value,

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,960
and then we let go of the relationship to the names,

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,320
which, for example, is a bit complex,

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,720
or a bit difficult to remember in the past, which is such a setup.

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,080
So then we can, for example, if we are going to set up a test environment,

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
then we can say, ok, should it be small, or something like that,

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,400
then it is mapped directly to how much VM size we get.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,160
So then we have looked at maps,

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
how we can, we can also specify

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,520
whether it should be string or number on maps in addition.

56
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,760
So then we have looked at both lists,

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,200
we have looked at maps, and we have looked at locals,

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,080
and we have looked at regular variables,

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,640
so then we are starting to get a pretty good basis for our further work,

60
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,600
where we are going to start building a little more complex infrastructure,

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,080
and use modules.

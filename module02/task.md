# Deploy and variables
In todays assignment we are going to test the following:
- Create a Terraform prosject with the resources of choice. We have been through vnet with subnet and nsg, storage accounts, etc. 
- Preform a deployment where you create a plan and apply with a plan-file. 
- Edit the infrastructure and do a plan and apply with tha v2-version of that infrastructure. 
- Afterwards perform a apply on the first plan-file. 
  - What happends to the infrastructure in Azure? 
  - Does it go back to the first version of the plan?

Pros and cons for using: plan-files, single plan file vs multiple plan files?

- Deploy a VNET with one or more subnets. Use variables for correct names for the location, name of vnet and subnets. Is there any other information that could have been set to variables?

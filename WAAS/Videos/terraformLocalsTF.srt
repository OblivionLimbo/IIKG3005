1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Okay, in the previous video we saw locals, where we added  them to main.tf.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,480
But of course, it is possible to make it more flexible than hardcoding the locals.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,000
We can createa new file, which we are going to name "locals.tf".

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,880
And then we can take a look at the example of locals,

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,120
and move them away from main, and into this new "locals.tf" file.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,360
In the case of the site, we are going to talk about a new site, which we are going to talk about.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:39,160
We are going to talk about a new film, called Verbalse, where we are going to talk about the same site.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,480
What we are going to do is to find out where we are going to talk about local sites and Verbalse.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,320
This site located in place is for the west, the complex,ähl.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,500
Not many of you know that.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,540
But what they communicate is what they do this week.

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,780
And the label represents their origin.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,960
So we are going to propose a practical example of the spots on which are known as Verbalse.

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,060
But Verbalse site is for the west.

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,080
The first thing is that we do aferbaruralalla.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:26,080
and some new variables, so you can learn, for example, a company, type string, description, company name, variable, so we will write, for example, project,

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:34,080
and then we can now store that we take with the company name, and we are in TerraformWives,

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:49,080
and then we will learn and write a project, and then we will write project, Tf, and then the project, Terraform, and so on, and so on.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Let's see what we have, let's see variables, and then we have a local, which we are going to take at the end.

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:10,080
For today we have a variable, which is called a company name, and then we have input to the variable name, which is also not input via the command line, but we do it in the Terraform Tf.

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Then we take the local number, and then we take and set a name to the company name, and then we will add a project name, but we might have more here, and then it is great that we can, for example,

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:52,080
this is a way we can take with it, or in the case of the Terraform, that we are going to have input from the variable name, so we are going to use a dollar time, and then we can go back to the scroll brackets, and then we can set the same name, and there is a variable, so we are going to take the company name,

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:22,080
and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and

24
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:52,080
then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take what is called company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to take the company name and then we are going to take the company name, and then we are going to film what is called company name, and then our company name is design name and we are going to film what is called project name, so is the company name and we are going to film what is called project name to film what is called project name, so sl платize the company name and we are going to film what is called project name and we are going to film what is called project name, and we are going to film what is called project name and the case number of data, and we am going to film what is called project name then we are going to film what is called project name and the case number of data, and then we are going to film what is called project name and then we will need to help some parts

25
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
And now it's important to know the real institute

26
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
and to tell you the question is

27
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,080
if the end is going to be a valid cause

28
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
that generates the cause we have on IDE IT.

29
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,080
And then we can see here that in the project

30
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,080
we can have a variable here.

31
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Variable, we will call the building code

32
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,080
and then we can create a string

33
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080
which we will see in the data.

34
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,080
And then we will call the building code

35
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,080
and then we will just set a number of numbers

36
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
and then we can represent

37
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,080
what we have with the institute of the building

38
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
for the end drift.

39
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
And then we will just use it

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
and then we will start to create a line.

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
And then we will see

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
and then we can see how we write

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
that this can be a tag

44
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
which is not supposed to be a specific tag for you

45
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
but it can be more like

46
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
a common tag

47
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
which is what we use

48
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
for this deployment

49
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
which we want in our company name

50
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
and in our project name name

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
which we do today

52
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
and we can only enter the information

53
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
if we want to deploy this

54
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
for an end drift

55
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
with an end to this name.

56
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
So let's take a little longer

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
to create a building code

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
and then we will create a tree

59
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
and then we will create a tree

60
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
on the next channel

61
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
and then you can see

62
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
the courseigers

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
to load that tree

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
and in it

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
we create everything thanks to it

66
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,060
we can first put a tree

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,080
to host the space

68
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,800
and then we can add

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
and the windows

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Tags, we say that today we have tags that will be a billing code, a company project that can be set.

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,080
If we are going to set this up, we are going to go to my TF Fill-over-S.

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,080
And then we say here, here we are going to go from 4 to 5, so if we are going to go here today,

73
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:08,080
then we will write local, then we will write comment tags, because we are not going to write, then we will write local comment tags.

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,080
And then we want this resource to set their tags, so information on the resource that will be released,

75
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,080
with this information, then the company name, project, then the company name and project, and the billing code for this project.

76
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,080
So now we are going to write a third form, plan out, with TF plan.

77
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,080
So we are going to write a resource that will be released, and we can now choose a double check call.

78
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,080
There is a large account that will be released, so we are going to be a resource group, and there is a tag that will be set on it.

79
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,080
And then we can just say here, and tags that will be set on it, and it has a little bit of a local.

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Here is a resource group name, which is from variable, and here is a name from variable, so it is location from variable.

81
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,080
There is a form, apply, name, plan.

82
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
So we want to install and deploy.

83
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,080
And when the deployment is released, we can now go to the portal.

84
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,080
We are going to take a resource group, we are going to create a new one, and here we are going to create a new one.

85
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,080
And here we are going to create a large account that will be released, and then we are going to write tags on the resource group.

86
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Building code, company, and project.

87
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:31,080
And this is a nice way to structure resources in it, and make sure that you actually find a future for people like me, for example.

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Or when you are there, you can have a building code that you are going to need to pay for this resource.

89
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Can we company it, and project it, and the next thing.

90
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,080
In the same way, we have gotten your tags into a large account, for example, and have codes.

91
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,080
There are two types of tags, two types of form.

92
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,080
With this selection, it is used by variables, and by locals.

93
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:02,080
In my field, locals, in my own field, variables, variables, in my own field, and with Terraform TF, Vars, and Phil.

94
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,080
And that was actually what I was thinking about by locals.

95
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,080
This is a multi-house, and a Terraform.

96
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Destroy for my community, so that I don't have a resource and a lot of money, when I don't have a lot of money.

97
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:24,080
After that, yes, I am going to take all the tags, and I am going to put them into a large account, and then I am going to say that the resource will be added.

98
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Destroy it completely, then all the tags are done.

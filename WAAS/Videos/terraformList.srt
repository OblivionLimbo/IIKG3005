1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this video we are going to talk about how we can use a little more complex variable type.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To start with, we have a lot of variables in module 3.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We can also write variables and write some examples here.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
AC regions for example.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You can also take notes and do.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here we are going to talk about my co-pilot.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can take all the variables.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have to write type.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have to write that we define a cos type variable.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And that will be a list.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In addition, we have to put in parenthesis,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in this list we are going to talk about.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Because it can be just a type of input in the house.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Because the other variables are different.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We define the string.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But if you have a list, it can be string.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Or it can be number.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So if we take string in this case,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
we are going to take the description.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And we can also write AC.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I assure you.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Resources.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And we can also have default value.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And here we have value.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It can be more brackets in the string.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And then we are going to see the strings here.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In short.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So if we take the string in this case,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and if we take the string in this case,

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
then we are going to take the string in this case.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Maybe it's not here.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We are not going to take the string in this case,

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
but we are going to take the string in this case.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And what we can see is that we have defined a list.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's not like an array or something like that.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But if you don't have it,

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
write the whole programming.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then we want to say that the input is here.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It starts always at 0.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the input is here.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And then it gets number 1 and then 2 and 3.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So we are going to take the string in this case.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So we are going to specify which one we want to have.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we are going to take the Western Europe here.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And then we are going to start to use the most.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So how we are going to say that.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So if we take the string in this case,

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
then we are going to go to my.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And then we can see here.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here we have already had a var location.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But we are going to just show it.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then we are going to use it on a resource group.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
For that we will be a var.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we will be a see region.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And then we will say that we can fill with.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And for example, specifically 0.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When we are 0, it will be the first in this list

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that we want to be West Europe in our case.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And then we are going to show it.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we go here.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We are going to save it.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And then turn it into it.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then turn it into it.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And then we turn it into it.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then we just...

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A, C, N, N, N.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, we are going to do this.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And then we say that we will definitely do this.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then we say that we will have different output points.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So when we set this up,

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
then we want to find information from the list.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And then we are going to use the resource list,

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
or the variable with a type of list.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you want to have any type of resource,

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
then we have to define, for example,

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
what we are going to do in Poland.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because we could not have had

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that this would have been

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Son, North Europe and Falls.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is not a lovely word for the list

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
where we define that we have one type in our case.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So we are going to start to check it.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If we exit from console,

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Toss on, turn on the plan.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But if we are not going to take...

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So...

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then we will write,

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because we want North Europe

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to be sent to the West Europe.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And then we will turn it on.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But because it is better.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And then we take the plan out.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
With the plan.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When the plan is done,

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
we can just check here that we have got

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that the start-check campaign

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is going to operate in North Europe.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And then we have decided that we can

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
find the information from a list.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That was actually what I thought about going

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
about with a list type.
